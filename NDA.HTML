    <p class="c2">National Defence Academy has emerged as an iconic Military Academy over years, attracting not only the
        finest young men from all corners of the country but also from friendly foreign countries. In the seven decades
        of its glorious existence, National Defence Academy has grown both in grace and grandeur. From its portals have
        graduated the 'The Leaders of the men', who have proved their worth and have demonstrated the essence of
        inter-services camaraderie and jointmanship, thereby vindicating the faith and vision of its founding fathers.
