    <p class="c2">The Joint Entrance Examination, JEE (Main) comprises two papers. Paper 1 is conducted for
        admission to Undergraduate Engineering Programs (B.E/B.Tech.) at NITs, IIITs, other Centrally
        Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs), and Institutions/Universities funded/recognized by
        participating State Governments. JEE (Main) is also an eligibility test for JEE (Advanced), which is
        conducted for admission to IITs. Paper 2 is conducted for admission to B. Arch and B. Planning
        courses in the country.The JEE (Main) - 2023 will be conducted in 02 (two) sessions for admissions in the next academic
        session This will give two opportunities to the candidates to improve their scores in the examination if
        they are not able to give their best in one attempt.
         In the first attempt, the students will get a first-hand experience of taking an examination and
        will know their mistakes which they can improve while attempting for the second time.
         This will reduce the chances of dropping a year and droppers would not have to waste an entire
        year.
        If anyone missed the examination due to reasons beyond control (such as the Board
        examination), then he/she will not have to wait for one entire year.
         A candidate need not appear in both Sessions. However, if a candidate appears in more than
        one Session then his/her best of the JEE (Main) - 2023 NTA Scores will be considered for
        preparation of the Merit List/ Ranking.
